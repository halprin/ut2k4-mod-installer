Version 7.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Plugged memory leaks including a major one
<li>Added a preference to label installed files (command+,)
<li>Added an install log that is viewed during installation and can be after the fact (command+option+L)
</ul>
<br>
Version 7.0.1<br>
<ul>
<li>Automaticaly opens up when you double click on a UMOD file in the Finder and auto-fills in the File Path and sets the mod type to UMOD
<li>.ut4mods can now be installed correctly
</ul>
<br>
Version 7.0:<br>
<ul>
<li>First version programmed in Cocoa/Objective-C and is an Universal Binary!  Other than that, the program is smaller, faster, and just plain better!
<li>No longer has a problem with spaces in the filepath to the UMOD
</ul>
<br>

I'd like to give thanks to a few identities:<br>
<font size=3>
<ul>
<li>Apple's own online documentation
<li>Siph0n for helping me when I had Cocoa problems
<li>The book "Programming in Objective-C" as before I read it I couldn't undertand an ounce of Objective-C
<li>The book "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X" as it helped me get past road blocks
<li>Borkware's quickies, Cocoa Dev Central, and the Cocoa Dev wiki that helped me when I hit road blocks
</ul>
