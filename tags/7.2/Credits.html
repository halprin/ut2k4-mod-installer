I'd like to give thanks to a few identities:<br>
<font size=3>
<ul>
<li>Apple's own online documentation</li>
<li>Siph0n for helping me when I had Cocoa problems</li>
<li>The book "Programming in Objective-C" as before I read it I couldn't undertand an ounce of Objective-C</li>
<li>The book "Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X" as it helped me get past road blocks</li>
<li>Borkware's quickies, Cocoa Dev Central, and the Cocoa Dev wiki that helped me when I hit road blocks</li>
</ul>
